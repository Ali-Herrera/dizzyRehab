# Dizzy Rehab Hub
The Vestibular Physical Therapist's Exercise Resource.

A place for PTs who treat individuals with vestibular conditions to collaborate. Make your own exercise to add to the collection, view ones others have made, like your favorites, and save the ones you use most frequently.

## Optimizations
One of the first things I would optimize is having the user name of the user who created an exercise show up on the card of each post in the explore page. I would also add other authentication methods for login services such as google authentication. Also, I would include functionality for users to reset their passwords.  



## Lessons Learned:

Utilized callback functions in the server to try and build a modular and scalable backend. Through this I learned , how to effectively simplify backend routes into independent functions.
